.. ccnSIM: NS-3 based CCN simulator documentation master file

Welcome
=======

The ccnSIM is NS-3 module that implements Named Data Networking (CCN) communication model, the clean slate Internet design. ccnSIM is specially optimized for simulation purposes and has a cleaner and more extensible internal structure comparing to the existing CCN implementation (CCNx).

We invite you to `join our mailing list <http://www.lists.cs.ucla.edu/mailman/listinfo/ccnsim>`_ to see and participate in discussions about ccnSIM implementation and simulations in general (`mailing list archives <http://www.lists.cs.ucla.edu/pipermail/ccnsim/>`_).
